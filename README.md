# WebAdmin Backend - @LogApi CS 1.6

### Status: Work in Progress (WIP)

The code is currently under development and may be somewhat disorganized.

### Features that won't work with the default @LogApi

The following features are not functional with the default version of @LogApi:
- **Slay** Menu
- **Team** Menu
- **Map** Menu

These events are not yet available in the standard @LogApi version. I am working on a **pull request** to have these events added to the API.

### To Do List
- Update LogApi with added new events.
- Finish text and comments translations.
- Clean up code.
- Do frontend.
